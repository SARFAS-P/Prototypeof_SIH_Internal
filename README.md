5. Schedule next visit
6. Sync data when online

### Scenario 2: PHC Staff Monitoring
1. Open dashboard in browser
2. Login with PHC credentials (9876543211 / 5678)
3. View patient overview
4. Monitor sync status
5. Generate reports
6. Export data

### Scenario 3: Offline Operations
1. Disable internet connection
2. Register patients offline
3. Record visits and vaccinations
4. Enable internet connection
